# EcoloGIS
This project aims to bring together the fields of movement ecology and data geovisualisation in order to develop an advanced web-based movement data visualisation tool, EcoloGIS.

### Prerequisites:
 - python 2.7 (sudo apt-get install python2.7)
 - pip - Python package manager (sudo apt-get install python-pip)
 - virtualenv - Python package for self-contained python environments (sudo pip install virtualenv)

### After installing the prerequisites:
To run the application on Linux systems execute the bash script run.sh, which should activate the python virtual environment, export the flask application evironment variable, and then start running a flask server locally. The URI of the server should appear in the console output - open this in the web browser of your choice (firefox / chrome recommended). The link should navigate you to [localhost:5000]/new/ and you should see the 'create a new study' screen of EcoloGIS.
