# EcoloGIS
This project aims to bring together the fields of movement ecology and data geovisualisation in order to develop an advanced web-based movement data visualisation tool, EcoloGIS.

To run the application on Linux systems, execute the bash script run.sh, which should activate the python virtual environment, export the flask application evironment variable, and then start running a flask server locally. The URI of the server should appear in the console output - open this in the web browser of your choice (firefox / chrome recommended). The link should navigate you to [localhost:5000]/new/ and you should see the 'create a new study' screen of EcoloGIS.
